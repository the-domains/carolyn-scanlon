description: "I'm Carolyn. I'm at this weird point in my life that feels like I'm about half way through, and statistically I am (well, just over, to be accurate). Half way rings true for me as I embark on my project of self-renewal, being 44, with an 88 year old father and a 4 year old daughter. I've also been granted the dubious blessing of early menopause, which kind of underlines the transitional nature of this time in my life."

I'm Carolyn. I'm at this weird point in my life that feels like I'm about half way through, and statistically I am (well, just over, to be accurate). Half way rings true for me as I embark on my project of self-renewal, being 44, with an 88 year old father and a 4 year old daughter. I've also been granted the dubious blessing of early menopause, which kind of underlines the transitional nature of this time in my life.

I like the idea of half time being a breather in a game - a time to look at the future game plan, catch your breath and refuel before getting back in there to play your best. A gentle and playful way to look at this period of preparation and change.

I want to explore perceptions of "middle age", as I reboot my health, career and lifestyle and work out what I'm going to do with the rest of my life. I'll be using myself as a bit of a guinea pig, documenting what I try and experiment with. It's now or never.
